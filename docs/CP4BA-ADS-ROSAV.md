## IBM ADS On IBM cloud pak for Business Automation 

IBM Cloud Pak for Automation offers design, build, run, and automation services to rapidly scale your programs and fully execute and operationalize an automation strategy.

[IBM Cloud Paks](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FIBM%2Fcloud-pak) meet standard 
criteria for packaging and deployment of containerized software with platform integrations. 
IBM Cloud Paks accelerate time to value, and improve enterprise readiness and business agility.

IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation helps to automate business operations with an integrated 
platform of automation capabilities. The platform relies on Kubernetes, which is open source 
application container orchestration software that makes it easier to configure, deploy, and manage 
containerized applications. It is designed to help all types of projects small and large, 
improve employee productivity, and deliver better end-to-end customer journeys while you reduce 
the burden of governing your content and processes. It can increase your ability to scale and do 
more work faster and better.

Automation capabilities empower your business to work more effectively in the following cases:

* When your headcounts are static, but the workload must manage new applications or services, 
rising customer demand, or seasonal fluctuations.
* When you want to create enhanced and personalized customer experiences that increase loyalty 
by drawing insights instantly from multiple sources of information.
* When you need to scale operations to help maximize revenue and customer service.

IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation offers a unified user experience for consistency across 
operations, reusable skills and assets that you can share between applications, and platform services 
that drive analytics and insight with operational intelligence. The platform can also coordinate its 
capabilities with your existing infrastructure. For example, content management for an insurance 
companyâ€™s case management needs. Content management can include searching files for relevant data, 
managing the business processes necessary for completing a claim, and providing decisions based on 
company policies.

The following diagram shows the capabilities of IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation and the core program offerings that the platform provides.

[IBM Automation Decision Services](https://www.ibm.com/automation/business-rules) (available as part of [IBM Cloud Pak for Automation](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-automation)) 
helps business users make the business decisions through a simple interface that requires no coding. Because conditions evolve, business users can also quickly 
change the way decisions are made and stay aligned with important business requirements.

Decisions are made with well-known conditions and well-defined policies. But they increasingly require you have a view into the future. 
ADS makes the link between AI predictions and concrete decisions simple and actionable for workers without AI expertise. 

## AWS ROSA

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/what-is-rosa.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/what-is-rosa.html) 

Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is a managed service that's available through the AWS Management Console. It helps Red Hat OpenShift users build, scale, and manage 
containerized applications on AWS. With ROSA, you can create Kubernetes clusters using Red Hat OpenShift APIs and tooling and have access to the full breadth and depth 
of AWS services. ROSA streamlines moving on-premises Red Hat OpenShift workloads to AWS, and offers tight integration with other AWS services. With ROSA, you can access 
Red Hat OpenShift licensing, billing, and support all directly through AWS.
There are no up-front costs required to use ROSA. You pay only for the container clusters and nodes that you use. With pay-as-you-go pricing, you don't have to 
worry about complex, multi-year contracts. This flexibility means that you can align your Red Hat OpenShift consumption in AWS with your business needs.


## Architecture

**Note:** Automation Decision Services also creates some jobs that request 200m CPU and 256Mi Memory. The following jobs are created once at the beginning of the installation and do not last long:

* ads-ltpa-creation
* ads-runtime-bai-registration
* ads-runtime-ums-registration
* ads-ums-registration

The ads-rr-integration job is started every 15 minutes, and is also short-lived.

The diagram below presents needed EC2 resources based on the above sizing

| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ldapUsername | DN tree to your users : Example : `CN=admincp4ba1,OU=Users,OU=cp4autoads,DC=corp,DC=cp4a,DC=rosa` |

##### **ibm-dba-ads-mongo-secret** 

| **gitMongoUri**     | mongodb://admin:pass@your  mongo cluster url:27017/ads-git?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **mongoHistoryUri** | mongodb://admin:pass@your  mongo cluster url:27017/ads-history?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin |
| **mongoUri**        | mongodb://admin:pass@your  mongo cluster url:27017/ads?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin |
| **runtimeMongoUri** | mongodb:// admin:pass@your  mongo cluster url:27017/ads-runtime?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin |
| mongoPassword       | your mongo admin user password                               |
